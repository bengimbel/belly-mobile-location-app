This is a React Native Application I created that can help users find businesses, restaurants, or establishments close to the user's location. It shows the search results in a map view and a list view. Also caches results so user can see results when they are offline. On the map view, it shows the users location. If you are trying to clone this repo, you need your own Yelp fusion API Key because I did not push mine up to github. It will not work without your own yelp fusion API key. Also if you are using a simulator, you need to put in a custom longitude and latitude location coordinates or else it will always show that you are in San Francisco.
